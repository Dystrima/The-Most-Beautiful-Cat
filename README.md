# The Most Beautiful Cat 🐾
 A website for my beautiful cat, Kuro 🐈, made by me.  
 ![Kuro](https://dc718.4shared.com/img/X5mQh6rAge/s24/189e0d46820/Carousel_1?async&rand=0.0962493404563245)

 ### Why ❓
 I started this website as a training 👩‍💻 before the selections for a junior dev bootcamp. And I continued it as I learned during the bootcamp to put my new skills into action ! 

### What's in it ? 📦
The website is made of 4 pages:
- Home page, *explaning the purpose of each page*
- Portfolio, *displaying pictures of Kuro with comments and likes*
- About, *containing everything you need to know about Kuro, what he likes, when he was born, etc.*
- Contact, *giving you the possibility to send a message of love to the beautiful Kuro*

### Progression 🎯
It's still a WIP, the home page (*index.html*) and the contact page are **done** !!  
I still need to do the Portfolio and the About pages.
