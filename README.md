# The Most Beautiful Cat 🐾
 A website for my beautiful cat, Kuro 🐈, made by me.

 ### Why ❓
 I started this website as a training 👩‍💻 before the selections for a junior dev course. 

### What's in it ? 📦
The website is made of 4 pages:
- Home page, *explaning the purpose of each page*
- Portfolio, *displaying pictures of Kuro with comments and likes*
- About, *containing everything you need to know about Kuro, what he likes, when he was born, etc.*
- Contact, *giving you the possibility to send a message of love to the beautiful Kuro*

### Progression 🎯
It's still a WIP, the home page (*index.html*) is **done**, I've got the structuration and content of all the other pages in Figma, but I still need to put everything in HTML files, and then add some CSS, probably some JS, and maybe think about the data base of the comments and likes on the porfolio and the messages on the contact page...
